# RSA Encryption and Signature Algorithm

## Description
This project implements a simple RSA encryption and signature algorithm in Python. The algorithm accepts two 16-bit prime numbers, `p` and `q`, as inputs and uses them to generate RSA encryption and decryption keys (`e` and `d`). With these keys, the program can encrypt and decrypt messages, ensuring secure communication. Additionally, the algorithm can validate the signature of the message to confirm its authenticity and accountability.

## Features
- **Key Generation**: Generates RSA public and private keys from two 16-bit prime numbers.
- **Encryption and Decryption**: Encrypts a plaintext message with the public key and decrypts it with the private key.
- **Digital Signature**: Generates and verifies a digital signature for message accountability.

## Usage
To run this algorithm, simply provide two 16-bit prime numbers as inputs. The program will guide you through encryption, decryption, and signature validation steps.
